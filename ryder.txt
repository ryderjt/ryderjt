My name is Ryder Thomas. I am a 16 year-old self-taught cinematographer and photographer working in both video and still formats. I handle projects from planning through final delivery, including shooting, editing, and color. I primarily use DaVinci Resolve for editing and color grading, Adobe After Effects for motion graphics and visual effects, Adobe Lightroom for photo editing, and Adobe Premiere Pro for fast-turnaround video edits. My work includes short films, social media content, documentary-style pieces, and photography for individuals and small brands. I shoot, edit, and deliver projects independently, allowing for consistent workflow, communication, and visual consistency across each project.
