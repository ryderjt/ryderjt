# Hey, I'm Ryder 👋  

> “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”

I’m a creator who loves making things from **video edits and cinematic visuals** to **small film projects and creative code**.  
I’ve spent years learning how to tell stories through editing, color, and motion, and I’m always experimenting with new forms of creativity.  

🎬 **Video Editing / Film** — After Effects, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve  
💻 **Coding / Projects** — Web, design tools, automation experiments  
🎨 **What I Love** — Cinematography, storytelling, learning new stuff
